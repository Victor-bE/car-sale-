As part of my bootcamp training, I undertook a project focused on analyzing data from second-hand car sales websites. The objective was to identify the key factors driving prices in the second-hand car market. To achieve this, I began by cleaning and standardizing the data before conducting linear regression analysis. Through this, I was able to determine the weight of each variable and found that mileage had a significant impact on car prices. Other influential factors included engine volume, brand, and registration details. Overall, this project allowed me to showcase my data analysis and regression modeling skills in a practical context.
